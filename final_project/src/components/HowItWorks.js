		  		<h2><u> Description: </u> </h2>
		  		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Our web app, a parking app, has been envisioned in two forms; The basic form and a fully realized form. Starting 
		  		with base of our application, which will be our main focus and goal, we will be building a web app, that takes suggestions 
		  		from our spotters (these are our valued users who find available parking spots, or are leaving the spot they were occupying,
		  		 and are gracious enough to share this information as updates on our parking app) and present them as an updated list on the web 
		  		app to our consumers, who will make their lives finding parking spots easier using said list. The official name we are giving to 
		  		our application is Parker. If time permits, we plan to add more features to our web app, like real time map updates of parking 
		  		spots, and also provision of incentives to our spotters, with support and sponsorship from interested third party companies.

		  		<h2><u> Persona: </u> </h2>
		  		<ul> 
		  			<li> <strong> Name:</strong> Savannah Quinn</li>
		  			<li> <strong> Role:</strong>Consumer</li>
		  		</ul>
		  		<h2><u> Basic Demographic information: </u> </h2>
		  		<ul> 
		  			<li> <strong> Age:</strong> 25</li>
		  			<li> <strong> Occupation:</strong> Student, Uber driver</li>
		  			<li> <strong> Gender:</strong> Female</li>
		  		</ul>
		  		<h2><u> Bio: </u></h2>
		  		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Savannah in a college junior in the City College of New York pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Business 
		  		Administration, who also works part time as an Uber driver to support her lifestyle. Savannah likes to hang out with her friends,
		  		 living the night life of New York City, and she’s always interested in making extra cash when she gets the opportunity. 
		  		</p>

		  		<h2><u> Motivation: </u> </h2>
		  		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Savannah’s love for driving made her an Uber driver. She realized that if she’s already driving to school,
		  		 why not head out a little bit earlier, make money driving people to their destinations, and then get back on track to her school 
		  		 when the time is due. She also saw the opportunity to do the same thing when going home from school, and even when she plans on 
		  		 going out with her friends. She realized that working this way, in addition to her already set-up time table for work, will bring
		  		 her much income. 
		  		</p>
		  		<h2><u> Goals: </u> </h2>
		  		<ul>
		  			<li> Be able to find parking easy and reliable parking close and around her school without wasting too much time. </li>
		  			<li> Spend less on paid parking and parking meters, and utilize that money for better agendas.  </li>
		  			<li> Have better alternatives to having to park at illegal spots. </li>
		  		</ul>
